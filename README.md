IDA Pro Full Instruction Reference Plugin - It's like auto-comments but useful.

I'm generally pretty good at figuring out what various Intel instructions do.
But, once in a while I need to either know some precise detail (i.e. exact 
side effects of SUB) or come across a rare instruction. Then I break my train
of thought and have dig out the reference manual. Which got me thinking: 
<i>Why can't IDA just give me the full documentation?</i>
